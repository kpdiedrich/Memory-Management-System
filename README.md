# Memory-Management-System
My attempt at a memory management system using C and pthreads. Still a work in progress.

This code can be run using the following example command:

./main_run 20 1 0

(20 for # of threads; 1 for first fit (2 for best fit, 3 for worst fit); 0 for no defragmentation (1 for defragmentation))
